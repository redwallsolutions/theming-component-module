# Theming Component Module

  

Theming Component is lib that implements theming logic to apply to react components built using styled-components.

  

## How to use it

	import {createThemeWithAppearance} from '@redwallsolutions/theming-component-module'
	
	const theme = createThemeWithAppearance()
	
	//now you can use theme const to have access to colors, contrasts and variants of 'default', 'primary', and 'secondary' appearances passed down to components.

Enjoy it.
